<h3><p>KYRIAKOS KALLIS</h3></p>
<p>Kyriakos Kallis’ focus is on the psychic impressions resulting from human activity occurring over 
time in the physical and social environment. He engages with notions of memory, identity and 
materiality, while investigating relationships and symbolism through their archetypal 
manifestations in space and time.</p>
<p>
Kallis studied sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague in the Czech Republic with a state 
scholarship (1981-1988).  
He has exhibited significantly as a solo artist and  participated in group exhibitions both in 
Cyprus and abroad, as well as taking part in various notable international events such as:
 «Settlements- Mountains upside down» (Werft Room 77,2024), «Ars Moriendi» (House of Cyprus,
  Athens 2016), “International Exhibition – Sculpture and Object XVII 
  Cyprus – Contemporary Sculpture”, (Bratislava, Slovakia2010).

Exhibition of Sculptures and Installations (Lido-Venice 2007), “Un Certain Regard:

  Greece 1997).“Six Young Artists” (‘K’Gallery, London 1993), “European Dialogue” (Bochum Museum
   of Modern Art, Germany 1993). </p>

and squares in Cyprus and the Czech Republic, such as: “Primitive Observer”, megalithic 
composition (Horzitce , Czech Republic 1994), “Heroes’ Monument”,  (Heroes’ Square,
 Aglantzia, Nicosia 2003). Kallis uses various expressive media and methods, traditional 
 and contemporary, such as sculpture, installations and  site-specific works.</p>
  <p>He also  employs ritualistic performances combining  primitive and contemporary elements to act 
 as fragments of nature or society that evolve, erode, recall and regenerate. By projecting
  places and times as universal experiential situations, he initiates new aesthetic experiences 
  and thoughts for dialogue and discussion.</p>
